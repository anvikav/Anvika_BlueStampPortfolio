The smart jacket is equipped with an array of sensors that offer intuitive assistance. From built-in object detection to real-time text-speech conversion, the jacket is designed to cater to various needs.

My journey doesn't end here. I'm excited to continue my education in computer engineering, refining my skills and expanding my horizons. I believe in the potential of technology to shape a better future and I hope this project serves as an inspiration to other young minds.

  The first step of this project was to develop a simple system that assists visually-impaired individuals navigate a space. It alerts the user of objects within a 70cm radius with either haptic or auditive feedback (a vibrating motor or buzzer). As the object gets closer to the user, the system responds with more frequent vibrating or buzzing; a toggle switch is used to change between the motor and the buzzer. Additionally, to establish a visual debugging method, the circuit has a 5mm red LED that lights up in harmony with haptic or auditive feedback. Next, I will expand this gadget to make it multi-functional, like adding a Raspberry Pi to translate text into Morse code or attaching it to a jacket to make it a usable garment.

### First Milestone Code
```c++
  const int pingTrigPin = 3; //Trigger connected to PIN 3
  const int pingEchoPin = 2; //Echo connected to PIN 2
  const int buz = 4; //Buzzer connected to PIN 4
  
  void setup() 
  {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(buz, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(pingTrigPin, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(pingEchoPin, INPUT);
  }
  
  void loop()
  {
    long duration, cm; //Variables for wave duration and wave distance   
    digitalWrite(pingTrigPin, LOW); //Confirming that the trigPin is clear   
    delayMicroseconds(2);
    digitalWrite(pingTrigPin, HIGH); //Generating a wave by setting trigPin to HIGH for 5 minroseconds and then back to low
    delayMicroseconds(5);
    digitalWrite(pingTrigPin, LOW);
    duration = pulseIn(pingEchoPin, HIGH); //Storing the travel time is variable duration
    cm = microsecondsToCentimeters(duration); //Converting to distance   
    if(cm<=70 && cm>0) //Makes the light blink faster when the distance is smaller --> starts blinking at 70cm
    {
      int d= map(cm, 1, 100, 20, 2000); //d stores a variable that reformats a range
      digitalWrite(buz, HIGH); //Turning light on for .1 second  
      delay(100);
      digitalWrite(buz, LOW); //Turning light off 
      delay(d); //Waiting for a time that corresponds to the variable cm
    }
    Serial.print(cm);
    Serial.print("cm");
    Serial.println();
    delay(100);
  }
  
  long microsecondsToCentimeters(long microseconds)
  {
    return microseconds / 29 / 2;
  }
```

<!--![MilestoneTwo](MilestoneOne.png)-->

  The first modification I implemented started from the idea of a text-to-braille translator. I planned to use Raspberry Pi OpenCV to read text and use an Arduino Micro to control a braille display. However, with the idea of this display came a plethora of technical problems. Creating a display small enough to be portable and lightweight while still translating more than a sentence at a time into braille would require extremely small motors and sensors. Then came the development of a Morse Code translator using the same vibrating motor from the base project. 

### Second Milestone Code for Morse Code Translator (Arduino)
```c++
void loop() 
{
  char ch;
  if (Serial.available())
  {
    ch = Serial.read(); // read a single letter if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z')
    Serial.print(ch);
    if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z')
    {
      flashSequence(letters[ch - 'a']);
    }
    else if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') 
    {
      flashSequence(letters[ch - 'A']); 
    }
    else if (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9') 
    {
      flashSequence(numbers[ch - '0']); 
    }
    else if (ch == ' ') 
    {
      delay(dotDelay * 4);
    }
  }
}  
```
  
  Later, I realized that Morse code, like Braille, is not an accessible method of communication; as a matter of fact, only 1% of the population can understand Morse code. So to complete this milestone, I decided to create a text-to-speech translator and control it with a Raspberry Pi. The first step was connecting my Pi to my computer remotely. I encountered a setback in this process when my computer (Mac OS) had trouble connecting to my Pi through a VNC Server and lagged noticeably when connected through a terminal. After 4 days of trying to debug the problem, I decided to reflash the SD card in the Pi and connect it to a monitor.
  
  After establishing a strong connection to the Pi, I started working on live text recognition using Python. I soon faced the issue of dealing with blurry photos that the Pi was unable to read. By manually adjusting the focus of the PiCam and going through several rounds of testing, I successfully converted text into speech. 
  
  Finally, I added a battery pack to my starter project:

### Schematics Part 2
  Before I started to work on my third milestone, I made a circuit diagram on Tinkercab for the object detection system on the jacket:
